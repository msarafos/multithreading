### notes.

-- Our job here is to implement a program, using the `pthread library`, which is based to the idea of the pseudocode uploaded.\
-- A `numbers.txt` file is going to be generated if the `num_generator.py` is executed.\
-- Compilation: `gcc -Wall -g primes.c -o primes -lpthread -lm`.\
-- Execution: `./primes 'num_of_workers' < numbers.txt`
