### notes.

-- Our job here is to implement a program, using the `pthread library`, which is based on the idea of the train-passengers (exercise3) problem, but with a slight difference.\
-- Important difference: Priority is given to `women`.\
-- Compilation: `gcc -Wall -g shared_wc.c -o shared_wc -lpthread`.\
-- Execution: `./shared_wc 'max_people_inside'`.
